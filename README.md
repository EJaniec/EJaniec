<h1>Hi, I'm Evan! 

<h2> About Me </h2>
  
- I'm an alum of Mount St. Mary's University, where I earned my B.S. in Business Administration, and Lindenwood University, where I achieved an MBA in Marketing. 
  
  I am currently dedicated to enhancing my skills and knowledge by pursuing a Cybersecurity certification. My goal is to combine my background in business and marketing with my future expertise in Cybersecurity to make a significant impact in the field of military defense and contracting. I'm excited to explore opportunities in this dynamic and critical sector, where I can contribute my passion, education, and experience to help protect and support our nation's defense needs.
